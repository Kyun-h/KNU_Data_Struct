the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. the dog barked loudly, but the fox was too quick. 
quick thinking saved the fox again. the dog, tired and lazy, went to sleep. 
but when the sun rose, the fox was already awake. it looked around carefully and dashed into the forest.
the dog, still sleeping, did not notice a thing. the quick fox had learned to stay one step ahead. 
lazy dogs never win against quick foxes. and that is how the fox survived, again and again.
